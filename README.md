# TASK 2 â€” Simple Calculator ðŸ§®

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This is a **basic calculator program** written in **C++**.
It takes a mathematical operator (**+**, **-**, **\***, **/**) and two numbers from the user, then performs the selected operation and displays the result.

If the user enters an invalid operator, the program displays an **error message**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

* Supports **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.
* Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface.
* Handles invalid operator inputs gracefully.

---

## ðŸ“‚ How to Run

1. **Compile the program**:

   ```bash
   g++ task2.cpp -o task2
   ```
2. **Run the program**:

   ```bash
   ./task2
   ```

## ðŸ“‹ Example Gameplay

**Run Example 1** (Addition)

```
Enter operator: +, -, *, /: +
Enter two operands: 5 3
5 + 3 = 8
```

**Run Example 2** (Division)

```
Enter operator: +, -, *, /: /
Enter two operands: 10 4
10 / 4 = 2.5
```

**Run Example 3** (Invalid Operator)
